<p>A father of five, Geoff was born in Melbourne and grew up in Melbourne and Western Victoria.</p>
<p>He studied Medicine at Monash University and after graduation worked at Western General Hospital in Footscray and Preston and Northcote Community Hospital (PANCH) before embarking upon specialist training at the then Queen Victoria Hospital in central Melbourne.</p>
<p>Geoff spent the last three years of the six years specialist training in England where he worked at Pembury Hospital near Tunbridge Wells, Kent and Heatherwood Hospital, Ascot, opposite the famous Ascot Race Course.</p>
<p>He has also lived in Japan and worked as a volunteer surgeon performing gynaecological operations in remote areas of Nepal.</p>
<p><i>"My connection with the Mornington Peninsula goes back a long way. My maternal grandfather had an orchard and farm at Red Hill and, although he had passed away before I was born, I grew up spending many happy summers on the Peninsula including swimming at Dromana and Point Leo, and visiting the many relatives who then had orchards and farms there."</i></p>
<p><i>"As a boy I worked in my holidays on various farms and orchards, and today retain an interest in farming, living with my wife and two daughters on a 40 acre hobby farm. I also have a Dip. Ag. Sci."</i></p>
<p>When not working, Geoff enjoys a busy family life much of which revolves around horses.</p>
<p><i>"Involvement with horses reminds me of my own roots and the history of this country. Both my grandfathers were horsemen; one driving a horse team to transport produce to the railway station, the other driving horses on the Western Front in the Great War. And looking after the pregnant mares, and the excitement around the arrival a new foal, has obvious parallels with my vocation as obstetrician and gynaecologist."</i></p>
