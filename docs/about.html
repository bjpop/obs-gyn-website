<p>A father of five, Geoff was born in Melbourne and grew up in Melbourne and Western Victoria.</p>
<p>He studied Medicine at Monash University and after graduation worked at Western General Hospital in Footscray and Preston and Northcote Community Hospital (PANCH) before embarking upon specialist training at the then Queen Victoria Hospital in central Melbourne.</p>
<p>Geoff spent the last three years of the six years specialist training in England where he worked at Pembury Hospital near Tunbridge Wells, Kent and Heatherwood Hospital, Ascot, opposite the famous Ascot Race Course.</p>
<p>He has also lived in Japan and worked as a volunteer surgeon performing gynaecological operations in remote areas of Nepal.</p>
<p>When not working, Geoff enjoys a busy family life much of which revolves around horses including taking his two youngest daughters to Pony Club and various horse riding competitions and more recently breeding of potential eventing horses.</p>
<p><i>“Involvement with horses reminds me of my own roots and the history of this country. Both my grandfathers were horsemen; one driving a horse team to transport produce to the railway station, the other driving horses on the Western Front in the Great War. And looking after the pregnant mares, and the excitement around the arrival a new foal, has obvious parallels with my vocation as obstetrician and gynaecologist.”</i></p>
