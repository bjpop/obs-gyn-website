<h3 id="insured-patients">Insured patients</h3>
<p>Dr McCallum is a “No-Gaps” provider for in-hospital gynaecological surgery and maternity care in private hospitals if you are insured with a “No Gaps” fund. “No Gaps” funds include, but are not limited to, Medibank Private, Bupa, HCF, NIB and funds which come under the Australian Health Service Alliance umbrella. This means Dr McCallum will not charge you any out of pocket costs for in-hospital gynaecological surgery or maternity care. Dr McCallum bills your health insurance fund directly. Private insurance only covers in hospital medical expenses therefore there will be out of pocket expenses for obstetric and gynaecological care provided in the consulting rooms. Details can be obtained by contacting the rooms.</p>
<p>If you are insured with a fund which does not participate with the “No Gaps” scheme you will be provided with an estimate for the proposed operation or delivery. Please note that that the estimate may be subject to change and will be dependant upon the Medicare item number of the actual operation or delivery. After your surgery or in-hospital maternity care an invoice will be sent to you. It is expected that you pay the invoice in full then claim through your health fund.</p>
<h3 id="self-funding-patients">Self funding patients</h3>
<p>It is also possible to have your surgery or baby delivered by Dr McCallum in the private system even if you do not have private insurance by self funding the operation or delivery.</p>
<p>You will be provided with an estimate for the proposed operation or delivery by Dr McCallum’s staff. Please note that that the estimate may be subject to change and will be dependant upon the Medicare item number of the actual operation or delivery. After your surgery or in hospital maternity care an invoice will be sent to you. It is expected that you pay the invoice in full then claim through Medicare.</p>
<h3 id="out-of-pocket-costs-for-other-doctors-involved-in-your-care">Out of pocket costs for other doctors involved in your care</h3>
<p>There may be other doctors involved in your surgery or in-hospital maternity care which may send you a bill for their services. These include but are not limited to the Anaesthetist, the Surgical Assistant and the Paediatrician. Where it is known in advance that these specialists will be required, a quote may be obtained.</p>
<p>As these professionals are all individual doctors you will be sent an invoice for their services from their rooms.</p>
<h3 id="hospital-excess">Hospital excess</h3>
<p>Depending on your level of insurance and the structure of your policy you may be charged a hospital excess for your hospital admission. We advise that you check with your health fund prior to admission. If you are self funding you will usually be required to pay for your in hospital costs up front. A quote will be prepared for you prior to admission.</p>
